Sales Analysis:
Part 1: Sales and Profitability Analysis
Merged the List of Orders and Order Details datasets on the basis of Order ID by Inner join using Power Query Editor .
Calculated the total sales (Amount) for each category across all orders.
• For each category, calculated the average profit per order and total profit margin
(profit as a percentage of Amount).
• Identified the top-performing and underperforming categories based on these
metrics and visualized in a table chart. Also, suggested reasons for their performance diEerences.

Top-Performing Categories
✅ High Total Sales
✅ High Profit Margin (%)
✅ High Average Profit per Order
➡ These categories generate strong revenue efficiently.

Underperforming Categories
❌ Low or Negative Profit Margins
❌ Low Average Profit per Order
❌ High Sales but Low Profits
➡ These categories might have high costs, low pricing, or low demand.

Possible Reasons for Performance Differences
Why Some Categories Perform Well?
High Demand Products – Popular items like electronics sell in large volumes.
Better Pricing Strategy – Higher margins mean the pricing is optimized.
Low Returns & Discounts – Fewer returns lead to higher net profits.

High Return Rates – Frequent refunds impact profitability.
Supply Chain Costs – Expensive shipping or production increases costs.
📈 Recommendations
🔹 Increase focus on high-margin categories with marketing & inventory.
🔹 Improve pricing for underperforming categories to raise margins.
🔹 Reduce operational costs (supply chain, storage, discounts).
